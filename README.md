# Bikesharing Proposal for Des Moines

## Overview of the Analysis Project
After our clients' highly positive experience with citiBike in New York City, we drew up this analysis project to present why a similar bikesharing program should be set up in Des Moines and what are the relevant factors to consider based on this bike trip analysis. For highly aesthetic and easily understandable data visualization, Tableau (Public) is used.

Captions on each Tableau slide provides more detailed storytelling regarding the data but to briefly describe what the key points are for each of the visualizations:

1. The first visualization is the _"Number of trips based on hour of the day in August"_ and it shows that popular hours are between 7AM and 8PM. This informs our project when we should ensure we have an abundance of available bikes.
2. The second visualization is the _"Heatmap depicting popular hours of bikesharing during the entire week_ and it shows that use is more often around the commuting hours on weekdays (i.e. start and end of business day).
3. The third visualization is the _"Average trip duration based on birth year_ and it shows that the younger population (those born after 1990) utilize bikesharing more. This informs us that our marketing should be targeted towards this age cohort.
4. The fourth visualization starts to focus on the exploration of gender differences, starting with _"Common trip duration times based on gender"_ and we can see that men tend to use the Citibikes more often and for longer trips.
5. The fifth visualization then explores _"Popular hours for bikesharing based on gender_ and we can see that both men and women tend to use Citibikes around the commuting hours but overall, men uses them more.
6. The sixth visualization explores how user plans can affect bikesharing use with the _"Frequency of use based on usertype and day of the week"_. From this heatmap, it can be seen that subscribers utilize bikesharing in a much higher frequency than temporary customers. Based on the heavy use during commmuting hours (on weekdays) among subscribers, that group most likely use bikesharing as commute whereas temporary customers use for recreation purposes on weekends. As such, it is important for our bikesharing program to contain programs for commuting (subscribers) and leisure (customers).
7. The seventh, and final, visualization explores the _"Trip duration among Citibike users"_ and it is found that most trips are under 60 minutes. This tells us that bikes should have enough battery to last for at least 60 mins until another charging station. As such, we can infer that stations should be only at most 1 hour away from each other.
