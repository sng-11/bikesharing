# Bikesharing Proposal for Des Moines

## Overview of the Analysis Project
After our clients' highly positive experience with citiBike in New York City, we drew up this analysis project to present why a similar bikesharing program should be set up in Des Moines and what are the relevant factors to consider based on this bike trip analysis. For highly aesthetic and easily understandable data visualization, Tableau (Public) is used.
